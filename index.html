        <h3>Why did I make this page?</h3>
        <p>Breath of the Wild is a complex Zelda game, 
        and it can be difficult to memorize all the items that 
        could be useful to you in-game, even after completing it.
        Making a reference page seemed useful.
        This is why I made this page, so it can be used 
        as reference to any Zelda recipe that has been discovered, 
        so you don't need to waste any rare items, thinking you made the right thing, 
        but you didn't.</p>
