                    <h3>Why did I make this page?</h3>
                    <p>Breath of the Wild is a complex Zelda game, 
                    and it can be difficult to memorize all the items that 
                    could be useful to you in-game, even after completing it. In this case, knowing
                    how to make good recipes is important, because they prevent game over screens,
                    by healing damage.
                    Making a reference page seemed useful.
                    This is why I made this page, so it can be used 
                    as reference to any Zelda recipe that has been discovered, 
                    so you don't need to waste any rare items, thinking you made the right thing, 
                    but you didn't.</p>
