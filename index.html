                    <fieldset>
                        <h3>How can this page be useful?</h3>
                        <p>Breath of the Wild is a complex Zelda game, 
                        and it can be difficult to memorize all the items that 
                        could be useful to you in-game, even after completing it. In this case, knowing
                        how to make good recipes is important, because they prevent game over screens,
                        by healing damage.
                        Making a reference page seemed useful.
                        This is why I made this page, so it can be used 
                        as reference to any Zelda recipe that has been discovered, 
                        so you don't need to waste any rare items, thinking you made the right thing, 
                        but you didn't.</p>
                    </fieldset>
                    <br/>
                    <details> <!--This is to mimic an FAQ page-->
                        <summary>Which page should I go to?</summary>
                        <p>Each recipe has been categorized based on where the recipe can be found by either looking at a poster or reading books. 
                            For example, if the recipe can be seen on a poster or in a book in Rito Village, then it will be found on the Rito page.</p>
